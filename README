qr â€“ Convert text files to QR code

USAGE: ./qr [OPTION]... [--] [-|INFILE [-|OUTFILE]]

Options:
  -h, --help  Display this help

qr will read text from INFILE, convert it into QR code, verify the output and
and write the output (a PNG image) into OUTFILE.

Bug: zbarimg seems to handle raw 8-bit input as Shift-JIS, making the
verification fail for non-ASCII text.
